## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

| ADR | Decision | Rationale | Key Tradeoff |
|-----|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **ADR-001** | Tauri v2 over Electron | ~10MB binary; Rust backend for security/perf; native OS webview | Smaller ecosystem than Electron |
| **ADR-002** | ReactFlow for diagramming | MIT license; React-native; excellent performance; active dev | Required custom work for DFD conventions |
| **ADR-003** | Custom YAML file format | Human-readable; git-diffable; familiar to developers | YAML indentation gotchas; mitigated by strict schema validation |
| **ADR-004** | Zustand for state | Minimal boilerplate; great TypeScript support; performant | Less middleware than Redux; not needed at this scale |
| **ADR-005** | BYOK AI (user-provided keys) | Zero cost to project; no rate limiting; user controls data | Requires user to have API key; AI is optional |
| **ADR-006** | Inline layout data | Positions stored inline on each element in the `.thf` file; single-file portability | Slightly larger diffs when repositioning; but eliminates sidecar file complexity |
| **ADR-007** | AES-256-GCM encrypted file storage for API keys | Cross-platform without OS-specific keychain quirks; secure at rest | Managed by app, not OS keychain |
| **ADR-008** | Tailwind + shadcn/ui | Lightweight, customizable, excellent dark mode, growing Tauri adoption | More manual composition than MUI |
| **ADR-009** | Additive schema growth keeps `version: "1.0"` | Additive optional fields break nothing, so bumping would make every already-shipped build refuse to open every new file; `validate_version` stays exact-match and fail-closed. Full argument in [`file-format.md`](file-format.md#schema-versioning-policy) | An older desktop build that opens and saves a newer document silently discards the sections it does not know |
| **ADR-010** | Per-document state lives in swapped store bundles, not copied checkpoints | Each open document owns real model/canvas/history store instances; activation repoints the store facades at that document's bundle. Nothing is copied on switch, so no field can be forgotten and leak across documents, and every future document field is per-document by construction. Full rationale in [`docs/plans/53-document-registry.md`](../plans/53-document-registry.md) | `activateDocument` has no production caller until the tab UI (`#54`) renders more than one document at a time |

## Document registry and per-document state scope

ThreatForge shows one document at a time today, but the state layer already hosts many
independent documents. `src/stores/document-registry.ts` (`useDocumentRegistry`) owns every open
document and holds the single active-document pointer — the only global document-selection state.

**Session and bundle.** Each open document is a `DocumentSession` (`src/types/document.ts`): a
stable `DocumentId`, a `createdAt` stamp, its own `DocumentStores` bundle, its `fileSettings`, and
an `activeChatSessionId` reference. A bundle (`src/stores/document-stores.ts`) is three real store
instances built by injected factories in dependency order — history, then model, then canvas — so
a document's canvas store can only ever write into its own model and history stores
(`createCanvasStore({ model, history })`). Module-level mutable values that used to be shared by
construction (history-debounce keys, the pre-drag and nudge gesture snapshots, and the
`comp-`/`flow-`/`boundary-` id counters) now live inside each factory closure and are therefore
per-document.

**Bundle swap, not copy.** Activating a document repoints the facades at that document's bundle; it
never copies state. `useModelStore`, `useCanvasStore`, and `useHistoryStore` (`model-store.ts`,
`canvas-store.ts`, `history-store.ts`) are facades over an active-bundle pointer
(`setActiveStores`/`useActiveStores`): the hook form subscribes through the pointer so a switch
re-renders and re-subscribes React consumers, while `getState`/`setState`/`subscribe` delegate to
the active bundle. Because nothing is copied, a field added to a factory-created store is
per-document automatically and cannot be forgotten on a later switch. That is the decisive reason
the design chose bundle-swap over a checkpoint/restore field list (ADR-010).

**Scope rule.** Document-scoped state must be exactly as the user left it when they return to the
document. Workspace-scoped state belongs to the single window, the mounted canvas, or the user.

| Scope | State |
|-------|-------|
| Document | `model`, `filePath`, `isDirty`, the four selection ids, `isAnalyzing`, `nodes`, `edges`, `viewport`, `pendingLayout`, history `past`/`future`, id counters, history-debounce state, pre-drag and nudge gesture snapshots, `fileSettings`, `activeChatSessionId` |
| Workspace | ReactFlow instance handles (`rfFitView`/`rfZoomIn`/`rfZoomOut`/`rfPanBy`) and in-flight pointer gesture state in `canvas-instance-store.ts`, clipboard contents, `ui-store` (panels, theme, `canvasLocked`, dialogs), `settings-store.settings`, chat provider and `hasApiKey`, onboarding, and update state |

Anything not listed as workspace is document-scoped. `fileSettings` is owned by the
`DocumentSession` record; the session-ownership PR (`#127`) removes the vestigial `fileSettings`
field still declared on `settings-store` once every reader uses the session record.

**Module graph (acyclic).**

```
model-store-factory.ts ─┐
canvas-store-factory.ts ─┼─> document-stores.ts ─> document-registry.ts
history-store-factory.ts┘        ^
                                 │ (facade only)
        model-store.ts ──────────┤
        canvas-store.ts ─────────┤
        history-store.ts ────────┘
```

No store module imports `document-registry.ts`. `document-stores.ts` seeds a scratch bundle at
module load, so a unit test importing only `@/stores/model-store` still gets a model store wired to
the same history store that `@/stores/history-store` resolves to.

**Document ids never enter `.thf`.** `createDocumentId()` (`src/lib/document-id.ts`) returns a
branded `doc-<uuid>` from `crypto.randomUUID`/`getRandomValues`, never `Math.random`, and never
derived from a path, title, or model content. Ids exist only at runtime and in workspace metadata.
The document model is stored and cloned as an opaque payload (`structuredClone` in the history
factory), so schema-unknown fields survive undo/redo and a document switch. `#53` adds no `.thf`
schema change, version bump, or migration.

**Isolation is proven, not asserted.** `src/stores/document-registry.test.ts` carries the ten-case
isolation suite (plan step 9); each case fails both for a leak and for the opposite defect of
wiping a document's state on switch. Case 10 lives in
`src/components/layout/status-bar.test.tsx` and proves the facade re-subscribes through React.

### Handoff seams

- **`#54` (tab UX):** `useDocumentStores(id)` / `getDocumentStores(id)` expose a document's own
  bundle so a tab can render its title and dirty indicator without activating it. When the active
  document closes, `closeDocument` falls back to the most-recently-created remaining document; that
  close-activation policy is deliberately provisional and belongs to `#54`.
- **`#55` (browser recovery and export):** operates on the same registry sessions; it introduces no
  new document-identity concept.
- **`#56` (IndexedDB persistence):** the `DocumentSession` is the persistence unit and holds no
  credentials. `#56` adds an additive
  `hydrateDocument({ id, model, filePath, pendingLayout, createdAt, activate })` registry action
  that rebuilds a session under a *persisted* `DocumentId`/`createdAt` — where `createDocument`
  always mints a fresh id and always activates. See
  [`docs/plans/56-indexeddb-persistence.md`](../plans/56-indexeddb-persistence.md).
- **`#63` (AI conversation persistence):** the registry owns only `activeChatSessionId`, a
  reference — never conversation content. While chat storage stays keyed by `filePath`, two unsaved
  documents share the `threatforge-chat-sessions:unsaved` bucket; `#63` rekeys conversation storage
  to `DocumentId`. The session-binding effect and its `ai-chat-tab` effect-override limitation are
  carried by the session-ownership PR (`#127`).

```

## Security Architecture

| Layer | Approach |
|-------|---------|
| API Key Storage | AES-256-GCM encrypted file in app data directory |
| AI API Calls | Direct from user's machine with user's key; HTTPS only |
| File Integrity | Schema validation on read via strict serde deserialization |
| Auto-Update | Signed releases via Tauri updater with signature verification |
| Supply Chain | Dependabot + cargo-audit in CI; minimal dependencies |
| CSP | Strict Content Security Policy; no inline scripts, no remote code |
| Input Sanitization | Rust-side for file ops; React-side for UI; LLM output treated as untrusted |

See [SECURITY.md](../../SECURITY.md) for the full security policy and vulnerability reporting.
