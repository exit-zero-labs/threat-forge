# ThreatForge — Todo

Shared execution plan for humans and LLM agents. Update this file before, during, and after every work session.

## 2026-02-26 — README + repo compliance docs

### Plan
- [x] Rewrite `README.md` with proper project overview, dev setup, mission, contributing, license
- [x] Create `LICENSE` (Apache 2.0, owned by Exit Zero Labs LLC)
- [x] Create `NOTICE` (copyright attribution file for Apache 2.0)
- [x] Create `CONTRIBUTING.md` (how to contribute, code style, PR process)
- [x] Create `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (Contributor Covenant v2.1)
- [x] Create `SECURITY.md` (vulnerability reporting — critical for a security tool)
- [x] Create `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.yml` (structured bug reports)
- [x] Create `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature-request.yml` (structured feature requests)
- [x] Create `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` (PR checklist)
- [x] Create `.github/FUNDING.yml` (GitHub Sponsors)
- [x] Validate: all files created, links between docs are consistent

### Notes
- License: Apache 2.0 downloaded from apache.org — `NOTICE` file contains Exit Zero Labs LLC copyright
- Used YAML-based issue templates (`.yml`) for better structured input vs freeform Markdown
- SECURITY.md references GitHub private vulnerability reporting + email
- All emails point to `admin@exitzerolabs.com`, website to `exitzerolabs.com`
- README includes YAML file format example to hook developers immediately
